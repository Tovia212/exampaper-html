                <br/>
                <p> My grandfather’s mother on my Mother’s side of the family was    Mary Wise, who lived in Ireland. Ed Mahur, the man to
                    whom she was engaged, lived in the same village. He left for America, however, in 1837, two years before he was
                    twenty. She was to follow him when he had saved enough money to support a wife. Word came later that the ship on
                    which he supposedly had sailed had sunk, with all on board. Mary Wise was determined to go to America, anyway. She
                    secured work as a maid soon after reaching New York, as a sister had done before her. An almost unbelievable thing
                    happened then. Ed Mahur had not drowned, after all, having sailed on a different ship. Word from him had not reached
                    his family until after Mary had sailed. He learned from them that Mary was in New York and where she was working.
                    He found a job as a delivery boy in a grocery in the neighbourhood. He walked into the kitchen without warning one day.
                    Mary almost fainted, thinking that he was a ghost, but he soon convinced her that he was very much alive. (I might never
                    have arrived in this world if he hadn’t been would I?)
